# Fortia

Fortia is a strategy game that takes place in a fantasy world. You start off with a small town with a small population, but if you play the game right you can end up with an empire with a population in the thousands. 

There are several playstyles, and no one is right, you can mix strategies from different playstyles even to find the one that suits you perfect.

You can be an aggressive player, fighting everyone you can manage, plundering and threatening your way up the ladder of world dominance.

You can be a team player forming alliances with other player and use diplomacy to climb the ladder.

You can be a strategist carefully planning your every move like setting up the battlefield between you and your enemy with tunnels and traps before the battle starts.

You can even trade yourself up the ladder by trading resources for protection or putting out hits on other players towns.

How you play the game is up to you, there is endless possibilities.

A world can last years without a winner. Depending on what time you have you can set tasks to be automated or you can manually do them for the absolute optimal speed to get those tasks done, although when you get a really high population micro management is impossible and you will have to rely on higher level of automation.
